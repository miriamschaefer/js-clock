# Javascript clock ⏰

Exercise 2/30, part of the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

Used this exercise to keep on practicing my Javascript skills. In this particular exercise, the main goal is to practice `setInterval()` and the `getSeconds()` function and the `Date` object. Also, worked on my CSS skills with the `transition-timing-function`, which I had never used before.

- Javascript Vanilla.
- CSS3
